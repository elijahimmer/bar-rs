# bar-rs (name needs work)
it's a status bar... in rust...

License: MIT

This is just a person project for my own hyprland bar,
    and is not intended for use by anyone else.

You can go ahead and tell me, along with reporting bugs,
    but you are mostly on your own.

Features:
- Backlight Widget (with proper permissions)
- Battery Widget
- Volume Widget (dummy widget for now)
- RAM and CPU warning gauges
- A Clock
- Dynamic CSS loading (if build feature is enabled)

TODO:
- Get proper Backlight setting permissions (maybe through polkit)
- Actually, like, make the volume widget
- Add Hyprland Workspace icons.
- Likely some other stuff I cannot think of at the moment.
